  <h3>HOW TO READ THESE CHARTS</h3>
  <p>All axes are scored on a 1 to 9 scale, where scores are relative to the suppliers currently being compared, not fixed benchmarks.</p>
  <p><strong>For Ecobalyse, Price, Lead Time, and MOQ:</strong> Lower values are better. Suppliers with the lowest values receive higher scores (closer to 9), while suppliers with the highest values receive lower scores (closer to 1). When new suppliers are added, scores automatically rescale to reflect the new range.</p>
  <p><strong>For Transparency:</strong> This score is based on how many production steps are traceable (fibre, spinning, weaving/knitting, dyeing/finishing, making). The score is calculated independently as a completeness measure (known steps / 5 total steps), then scaled to the 1-9 range, not compared relative to other suppliers.</p>
  <p>If only one supplier is present, all axes score 5 to avoid showing a misleading "ideal" shape.</p>
