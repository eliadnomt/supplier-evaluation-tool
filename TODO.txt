Make the whole tool in french
Remove the explainer on the dashboard (makes it cheap)


When adding a supplier:
Sections should be separated between supplier and product information, 
and Bourrienne use case
Make the composition share height the same as the other fields in the row

SUPPLIER SECTION
Composition detail (currently material origin)
- set default option to be coton, but leave other options available
- remove the spinning information (have it set in Bourrienne params)
Fabric production specifications
- tricotage/tissage, make weaving the default


BOURRIENNE CONFIG
Have a config called Bourrienne-params, with Ecobalyse parameters 
specific only to Bourrienne:
Business size - always small-Business
Garment type - either chemise or pull (also jupe, they had one capsule
and robe, it's a chemise-robe, and veste (man capsule had one))
Spinning type - always conventional spinning if natural material,
otherwise synthetic spinning
Dyeing process - always average

Radar charts:
- deviation from median supplier price, not on a normalised scale. that way it's less cluttered and the shapes won't overlap on each axis.
- legend should be supplier name and fabric type
- change axis label to traceability not transparency
- chart size needs to be fixed not relative, too small axis labels
