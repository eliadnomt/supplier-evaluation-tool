Make the whole tool in french

dashboard
- make description sit underneath titles
- get rid of chart button and have an info tool tip in the chart canvas that explains each chart individually
- make the ecobalyse logo the button to access ecobalyse information, and have a label below it saying 'click for more info'
- make the charts have higher resolution

add supplier
- limit the garment type select menu to those in the bourrienne config

weighted comparison
- all the percentages need to add up to 100, so they should all start at zero, and have a checker when the sum total exceeds 100
- when apply to all charts is selected, the recommendation should be done per chart (makes no sense to have a recommendation for a supplier
for a single material, with different material options available)

ecobalyse
- update first explainer to have the link to the official ecobalyse simulator. 
- assumed constant fields update to 'assumed parameters'
- have a card: Bourrienne specifications
    - business size: small-business
    - spinning type: conventional spinning (with explainer) for natural materials
    - dyeing type: always average (explain what it means)
- do garment type cards (similar to the fabric cards in the supplier list) using an emoji for each type
- remove the variable fields table, include a statement that all other fields are dynamically set through the 'add supplier' modal
- get rid of how scores are calculated, score is no longer normalised, just shows percentage difference on actual score comparison.
