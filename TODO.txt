Make the whole tool in french

Radar charts:
- deviation from median supplier price, not on a normalised scale. that way it's less cluttered and the shapes won't overlap on each axis.
- legend should be supplier name and fabric type
- change axis label to traceability not transparency
- chart size needs to be fixed not relative, too small axis labels
