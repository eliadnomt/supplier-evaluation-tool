Make the whole tool in french
Remove the explainer on the dashboard (makes it cheap)


When adding a supplier:
Sections should be separated between supplier and product information, 
and Bourrienne use case
Make the composition share height the same as the other fields in the row

SUPPLIER SECTION
Composition detail (currently material origin)
- set default option to be coton, but leave other options available
- make the composition share percentage not decimal
- remove the spinning information (have it set in Bourrienne params)
- add fibre origin with drop down list of countries like the other origin fields
Country of origin renamed to Transformation origins
Fabric production specifications
- tricotage/tissage, make weaving the default
Gross fabric width (cm)
Weight (g/m2)
MOQ for production
Price for production(euro/m)
Lead time for production (weeks)

PRODUCTION RUN SECTION
Garment type (take options from bourrienne config)
Temps de confection (<5 min, 5-15 min, 15-30 min, 30-60 min, >60 min)
 - this will correspond to the different making complexities
 Number of garments (estimated)
 Price per garment (estimated)
 Lead time for garment production (weeks)


BOURRIENNE CONFIG
Have a config called Bourrienne-params, with Ecobalyse parameters 
specific only to Bourrienne:
Business size - always small-Business
Garment type - either chemise or pull (also jupe, they had one capsule
and robe, it's a chemise-robe, and veste (man capsule had one))
Spinning type - always conventional spinning if natural material,
otherwise synthetic spinning
Dyeing process - always average

Radar charts:
- deviation from median supplier price, not on a normalised scale. that way it's less cluttered and the shapes won't overlap on each axis.
- legend should be supplier name and fabric type
- change axis label to traceability not transparency
- chart size needs to be fixed not relative, too small axis labels
